# Insta-Followers-Bot
The selenium web driver has been used for the automation task. 
This project will require you to install the selenium webdriver, Chromedriver and Google chrome. 
 
This script open a google chrome browser window and logs in with the specified credentials. 
It then searches for hashtags specified inside the code and follows the profiles of, likes and comments on the posts 
that appear in the search results. 

The main idea behind this is, we can follow multiple accounts and most of them will follow us back thus increasing our followers' 
count.

The code that follows the users along with the complete tutorial is available on  the link below:

I have modified the code by replacing the XPaths of certain elements as the XPaths of the elements specified in the author's code
were quite outdated and the script wouldn't find the elements at runtime. 

I have also programmed the code that Unfollows the users.
