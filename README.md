Developed this project for one of the leading real estate developers in India.
The main idea behind this project is to target users based on the digital footprints or the information they have posted on Twitter and segregate those users based on their locations and engagement to target them through marketing campaigns. 
Also, to increase the effectiveness of the marketing efforts, an approach was devised and implemented that ranks the users based on their probability of being able to afford a real estate property in Mumbai or its neighbouring regions. 

Will be posting the entire description of this project soon. Can't post it immediately due to confidentiality reasons.
